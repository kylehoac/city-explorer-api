# City Explorer API

**Author**: Kyle Hoac
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview

In this lab assignment, I am building my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.
